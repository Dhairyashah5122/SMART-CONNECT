# This is an example of what a Genkit flow would look like in a
# separate Python backend service. This file is for demonstration purposes only.

import genkit
from genkit.flow import define_flow, run
from genkit import ai
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

# 1. Define the Input and Output Schemas (similar to Zod in TypeScript)
class StudentCandidate(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    resume: str

class RankStudentsInput(BaseModel):
    project_description: str
    students: List[StudentCandidate]

class RankedStudent(BaseModel):
    studentId: str
    matchScore: int
    justification: str

class RankStudentsOutput(BaseModel):
    rankedStudents: List[RankedStudent]

# 2. Define the AI Prompt
rank_students_prompt = ai.define_prompt(
    name="rankStudentsPrompt",
    input_schema=RankStudentsInput,
    output_schema=RankStudentsOutput,
    prompt="""
        You are an expert talent acquisition agent specializing in matching students to capstone projects.

        Your task is to analyze the project description and the resumes of all available students. For EACH student, provide a match score (0-100) and a brief (1-2 sentence) justification for their fit.
        Rank the students from highest score to lowest score in the final output array.

        Project Description:
        {{project_description}}}

        Available Students:
        {% for student in students %}
        ---
        Student ID: {{student.id}}
        Student Name: {{student.name}}
        Resume:
        {{student.resume}}
        ---
        {% endfor %}

        Evaluate all students based on their skills, experience, and how well they align with the project's requirements.

# 3. Define the Flow
@define_flow(
    name="rankStudentsFlow",
    input_schema=RankStudentsInput,
    output_schema=RankStudentsOutput,
)
def rank_students(flow_input: RankStudentsInput) -> RankStudentsOutput:
    """The main orchestrator for the student ranking process."""
    
    # Call the prompt with the input
    llm_response = run("call-llm", lambda: rank_students_prompt.generate(
        input=flow_input
    ))
    
    # Return the structured output
    return llm_response.output

# In a real Python backend (e.g., using FastAPI), you would create an API 
# endpoint that calls this 'rank_students' flow.
#
# Example with FastAPI:
#
# from fastapi import FastAPI
#
# app = FastAPI()
#
# @app.post("/api/v1/rank-students")
# async def handle_rank_students(request: RankStudentsInput):
#     # In a production app, you might run the flow asynchronously
#     result = rank_students(request)
#     return result
